# Final Documentation for Weekly Demo Videos
This repo contains a compilation of code and notes for the weekly demos completed for MSDS 434. While I tried to save copies of all my work, since much of the work was done on AWS and/or GCP there may be some missing pieces. Below, I have also included the links to my Panopto videos for each week.
