GCP AutoML Demo:
- Create new project
- Open BigQuery and create new dataset
- Run sample model from https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-automl

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `project_id.mydataset.mymodel`
       OPTIONS(model_type='AUTOML_REGRESSOR',
               input_label_cols=['fare_amount'],
               budget_hours=1.0)
AS SELECT
  (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS fare_amount,
  pickup_longitude,
  pickup_latitude,
  dropoff_longitude,
  dropoff_latitude,
  passenger_count
FROM `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
WHERE ABS(MOD(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING)), 100000)) = 1
AND
  trip_distance > 0
  AND fare_amount >= 2.5 AND fare_amount <= 100.0
  AND pickup_longitude > -78
  AND pickup_longitude < -70
  AND dropoff_longitude > -78
  AND dropoff_longitude < -70
  AND pickup_latitude > 37
  AND pickup_latitude < 45
  AND dropoff_latitude > 37
  AND dropoff_latitude < 45
  AND passenger_count > 0

- Took a little over 2 hours to complete
- Run predictions
